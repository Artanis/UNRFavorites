UNRFavorites (C) 2009 Erik Youngren <artanis.00@gmail.com>

To use:
1) Run with `python UNRFavorites` (or build your own launcher for it.)
2) Re-order the icons to your heart's content.
3) Click the save button (this is crucial.)
4) Restart netbook-launcher by either logging out and back in, or with
   `killall netbook-launcher`. If you choose the latter,
   netbook-launcher will restart itself and use the updated
   configuration values.
